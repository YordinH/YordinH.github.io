            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Day trading futures involves buying and selling futures contracts within the same trading day to profit from short-term price movements.
                 Futures are standardized contracts to buy or sell an asset (such as commodities, stocks, indices, or currencies) at a predetermined price on a future date. 
                 Unlike traditional investing, day traders do not hold positions overnight, reducing exposure to market risks that can arise after trading hours.</p>
            <p>Popular futures contracts include: S&P 500 E-mini, crude oil, gold.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>Learning to day trade futures can be highly rewarding if done correctly. 
                While it carries risks, it also offers unique advantages that make it appealing to traders seeking financial independence, flexibility, and scalability.</p><hr>
            <p>The market consists of two main types of participants:
                <br>
                Hedgers (Risk Managers)<br>
                
                Businesses and institutions use futures to hedge (protect) against price fluctuations.
                Example: A farmer sells wheat futures to lock in a price before harvest.<br>
                Speculators (Traders)<br>
                
                Day traders and investors use futures to profit from short-term price movements without owning the underlying asset.
                Example: A trader buys an S&P 500 futures contract expecting prices to rise.</p>

            <h2>Trading Hours</h2>
            <h3>Day Trading Futures Hours Overview</h3>
            <p>
                Futures markets operate nearly 24 hours a day, 5 days a week, allowing traders to react to global events outside regular stock market hours. However, each futures contract has its own trading schedule, with periodic breaks for maintenance.
                
                Futures Trading Sessions (CME Group - U.S.)
                Most U.S. futures contracts are traded on the CME Globex electronic platform, which follows this general schedule:
                <br>
                Trading Days: Sunday evening – Friday afternoon<BR>
                Open: 6:00 PM ET (Sunday)<BR>
                Close: 5:00 PM ET (Friday)<BR>
                Daily Break: 5:00 PM – 6:00 PM ET (maintenance period)</p>
            <h3>Best Trading Times for high volitlity</h3>
            <p>U.S. Market Open (8:30 AM – 11:30 AM ET)<BR>
                <BR>
                High volume and price movement in stock index futures (ES, NQ, YM).<BR>
                Economic reports released at 8:30 AM ET often trigger volatility.<BR>
                U.S. Market Close (2:00 PM – 4:00 PM ET)<BR>
                    <BR>
                Increased volume and volatility, especially in equities and energy futures.<BR>
                London & U.S. Overlap (3:00 AM – 5:00 AM ET)<BR>
                    <BR>
                Ideal for forex and commodity futures due to global liquidity.<BR>
                Avoid Low Liquidity Times (5:00 PM – 7:00 PM ET)<BR>
                    <BR>
                After the daily maintenance break, markets tend to be slow.</p>

            <h3>Order Book & Price Levels</h3>
            <p>

                Futures prices move based on supply and demand, shown in an order book.<br>
                Bid Price: The highest price buyers are willing to pay.<br>
                Ask Price: The lowest price sellers are willing to accept.<br>
                The difference between bid and ask is the spread.<br>
                
                Liquidity & Volume<br>
                <br>
                High volume means more trading activity and better price execution.<br>
                Futures like S&P 500 (ES) or Nasdaq (NQ) have high liquidity, making them ideal for day trading.<br>
                Support & Resistance Levels<br>
                <br>
                Support: A price level where buyers step in, preventing further decline.<br>
                Resistance: A price level where sellers step in, preventing further rise.<br>
                These levels guide traders in deciding entry and exit points.<br>
                Market Trends & Consolidation<br>
                <br>
                Uptrend: Higher highs and higher lows.<br>
                Downtrend: Lower highs and lower lows.<br>
                Consolidation: Price moves sideways between support and resistance.<br>

            <h2>Benefits</h2>
            <h3>Payouts</h3>
            <p>Prop firm payouts vary but generally follow these models:<br>
                
                Profit Split Model (Most Common): 

                Traders keep a percentage of profits, while the firm retains the rest.<br>
                Typical splits: 80/20, 90/10, or even 100% for an initial period.<br>
                Higher profit splits often come with stricter rules.<br>
                <br>
                Fixed Monthly Payouts<br>

                Some firms pay traders a fixed salary or monthly draw based on performance.<br>
                Less common but provides steady income.<br>
                Scaling Plans<br>

                Firms may increase capital and payout percentages as traders prove consistency.<br>
                Example: Start with a $50,000 account and scale up to $500,000 over time.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>Each firm has specific rules for withdrawing profits:<br>

                    Minimum Withdrawal Requirements<br>
                    
                    Traders may need to reach a certain profit threshold (e.g., $1,000) before withdrawing.
                    Payout Frequency
                    <br><br>
                    Weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly payouts (varies by firm).
                    Some firms offer instant withdrawals via crypto, PayPal, or bank transfers.
                    Consistency & Trade Frequency
                    <br><br>
                    Some firms require traders to trade a minimum number of days before cashing out.
                    Designed to prevent lucky one-off trades from triggering payouts.
                    Trailing Drawdown Rules
                    <br><br>
                    Many firms use a trailing drawdown, meaning the max loss level moves up as profits increase.
                    If the trailing drawdown is hit, the account is closed or reset.</p>
